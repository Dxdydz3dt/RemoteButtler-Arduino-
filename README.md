# RemoteButtler-Arduino-
In a big house, it is difficult always to call for the butler orally, therefore an electronic system is desired which allows the easy sending of some frequently-used instructions. The sender device has three buttons for different commands, on the receiver side a corresponding LED is lit and the buzzer beeps 1, 2 or 3 times.
The Arduino and Esp8266 wireless board is used for the project.
Thanks
